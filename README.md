# video2ascii

Uses [image2ascii](https://github.com/qeesung/image2ascii) and my extractframes script to convert a video to a textfile of ascii of each frame

Needs youtube-dl for url2ascii

this is super hacky and I made it for laughs to send videos to other people ssh'd in to the university server
